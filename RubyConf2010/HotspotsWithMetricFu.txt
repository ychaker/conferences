**Hotspots with MetricFu:**

what is MetricFu?
combination of a lot of metrics in one gem
code metrics in health of code, code coverage, code smells

code complexity analysis 
rcov
reek: code smell detectors 
roodi
RailsBestPractices
flog
saikuro (pronounced like sychro)
source control churn 

combining multiple reports into one

enter Hotspots 

Parse Ruby. ruby_parser will give you abstract syntax tree of some given Ruby as nested S-Expressions
used in quite a number of MetricFu metrics

get line number of that method

Hotspots magic rankifyer 

The Hotspots code in MetricFu is really the hot spot code 

if you run into problems running MetricFu, turn off rcov because it's the only one running things dynamically whereas everything else reads things statically

if you see something with high churn it better be very well test and a good method, because everybody is in there all the time, including your bad developers

2.0 release has been released yesterday (Nov 10th)
