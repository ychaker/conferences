**ZOMG Why is this Code So Slow?:**

@tenderlove

the best talk! 

AREL
AST manipulation and translation

Prepared Statement Caching

usually slow code is linked to bad code, we can make it faster if we get rid of bad code

what is fast enough?
do people notice it?
what is it compared to?
finishes in reasonable amount of time: relative
should improve only the code that matters


performance degraded
need benchmarks 

reduce: method calls, branching and looping, objects

same thing to achieve clean code

therefor clean code == performant code

ActiveRecord 3.0 5x slower than 2.3.5

after benchmarking:
double the number of calls to Time.now (Time and Date are the slowest ruby libraries)
now ActiveRecord is only 2x slower

Big O => OMG
when Big O gets big enough, you represent O with a Z => ZOMG

AREL O(n2)

should be AST + Visitor and O(n)

=> should rewrite

now O(n), 2x faster, DRY
