talks about his brain, literally! showing MRI shots
part of the brain was missing
got sent for some tests: functional tests
tests that failed: memory recall, and distinguishing voices

Push yourself to learn:
a new language next year
not just read about it
write at least '3000' (?) lines of code
ship it

haskell, python, scala, clojure, common lisp, IO, prolog, J, erlang


Ruby is in danger of becoming a suburb

cookie cutter
homogenous
judgmental
high ceremony 
== boring

great minds fine tuning other people's ideas 

i could do X better
of course you could ...
so what?

Do something new
Do something new worse...

Pioneering happens when people don't know what they're doing is stupid or dangerous 

and remember it's supposed to be fun
