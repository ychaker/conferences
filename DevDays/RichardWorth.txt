**jQuery:** 

Write less, Do more

changes the way you write JavaScript

it's just like reading english: 'take this element and do this with it'

**Method Calls:**

safe (0, 1, more elements)

no need for loop

some operate on first element

**Chaining:**

some methods modify chain

.end() to get back to previous

most methods are chainable

when the previous method takes time to complete, the chained method will execute immediately and won't wait, unless it's performing the same action (eg. animations will wait for previous animations to finish) 

**jQuery API:**

DOM Manip. (traversing, attributes, css/styles, DOM construction, overloaded, optional context)

Events

Animation

Ajax

separation between content and behavior (similar to use of CSS for separation of content and presentation)
