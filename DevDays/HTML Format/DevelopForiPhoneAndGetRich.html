<p><strong>App Store:</strong></p>

<p>$1 billion industry => $4B in 2012</p>

<p>2B downloads</p>

<p>100,000 apps</p>

<p>75% are paid apps</p>

<p>Games: 35%</p>

<p>Social networking, photography &#8230; 6%</p>

<p><strong>Why is iPhone successful?</strong></p>

<p>distribution mechanism</p>

<p>user experience</p>

<p>UI matters</p>

<p>There is money to be EARNED.</p>

<p>gotta work at it.</p>

<p><strong>What do you need?</strong></p>

<p>a Mac</p>

<p>Apple SDK</p>

<p>Devices are optional (don&#8217;t need to start there)</p>

<p><strong>Basic Rules:</strong></p>

<p>No 3rd party background apps</p>

<p>limited resources</p>

<p>live in a sand box</p>

<p>must use the published API</p>

<p>Mobile dev != desktop dev</p>

<p>very short time to interact with user</p>

<p>focused, task driven</p>

<p>view based</p>

<p><strong>Framework pattern:</strong></p>

<p>View -> View Controller</p>

<p>XCode/interface builder</p>

<p><strong>Simulator Issues:</strong></p>

<p>No camera</p>

<p>Single GPS</p>

<p>Limited gesture and accelerometer support</p>

<p>infinite memory and performance vs very limited on actual device</p>

<p>lax enforcement of permissions vs very strict on actual device</p>

<p><strong>App approval process:</strong></p>

<p>it will take 2 weeks to be rejected or accepted each time</p>

<p>they do test your app</p>

<p>they will eventually catch HIG or License Violations</p>

<p><strong>Now what?</strong></p>

<p>Analytics (be upfront about it)</p>

<p>Really had to make money with ad based apps</p>

<p>Localization</p>

<p>Two sales models: </p>

<p>1-$0.99 and sell a lot. marketing blitz. need to be in the top 100.</p>

<p>2-steady, traditional app. there is a market for more expensive apps.</p>

<p>New model: free app + in-app upgrade</p>

<p>tap tap tap is a good company to look at for iPhone apps.</p>
