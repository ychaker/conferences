**Why is iPhone successful?**

distribution mechanism

user experience

UI matters

There is money to be EARNED.

gotta work at it.

**What do you need?**

a Mac

Apple SDK

Devices are optional (don't need to start there)

**Basic Rules:**

No 3rd party background apps

limited resources

live in a sand box

must use the published API

Mobile dev != desktop dev

very short time to interact with user

focused, task driven

view based

**Framework pattern:**

View -> View Controller

XCode/interface builder


**Simulator Issues:**

No camera

Single GPS

Limited gesture and accelerometer support

infinite memory and performance vs very limited on actual device

lax enforcement of permissions vs very strict on actual device

**App approval process:**

it will take 2 weeks to be rejected or accepted each time

they do test your app

they will eventually catch HIG or License Violations


**Now what?**

Analytics (be upfront about it)

Really had to make money with ad based apps

Localization

Two sales models: 

1-$0.99 and sell a lot. marketing blitz. need to be in the top 100.

2-steady, traditional app. there is a market for more expensive apps.

New model: free app + in-app upgrade

tap tap tap is a good company to look at for iPhone apps.
